			Welcome to Necronomicompany, your first and best stop for purchasing your very own Necronomicon and associated products

		<h2> Our Mission</h2>
		<p>
			Our mission at Necronomicompany is to help our customers with whatever they need.  We here at Necronomicompany sell from only the finest of suppliers and are the only Nyarlathotep-approved sellers of the 
			Necronomicons!*

			*And by that we mean we were the only ones dumb enough to summon him over and over until he said yes. RIP 1,576 interns.
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
			
		<p>
			We hold ourselves to the highest standards, using only the finest quality paper and 
			"technically vegan" leather. We have a 100% guarantee that your necronomicon will work perfectly and 
			will not summon any dimensional shamblers or instances of the Haunter in the Dark. 
			If this should happen and you are still alive at the end, then we offer you a complete
			money-back guarantee.
		</p>

		<p style = "font-size:70%">
			For legal reasons, this is a joke. No Necronomicons are actually sold here and do not read from strange books promising dark powers 
			for your own safety and the safety of others. Yes, even if they promise you cupcakes.
